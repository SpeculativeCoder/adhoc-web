/**
 * When running as a manager, this application talks to a {@link adhoc.hosting.HostingService}
 * to ensure servers are representing each area in each region (and will start / stop servers accordingly).
 * There will likely only be a few (and typically just 1) manager application(s) running.
 * <p>
 * Servers communicate with the manager to let it know about events occurring in the world.
 * Events are handled by the manager and then emitted in the {@link AdhocArtemisConfiguration} cluster for kiosks to observe.
 * <p>
 * Typically, only {@link UserRole#SERVER} and {@link UserRole#ADMIN} users access the manager.
